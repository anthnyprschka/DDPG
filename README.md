# Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
Implementation of Lillicrap et al. (2015)'s DDPG algorithm in Tensorflow

## How to run
To run the algorithm on a toy problem, just do `python main.py`. By default it will train on OpenAI Gym's Pendulum-v0 environment and render every episode. It should take <100 episodes of training for satisfactory performance. For more robust performance, change noise decay to a close to but smaller than 1.
